#### 1. What are the boolean values in your language? (e.g., True and False, true and false, 1, and 0,  etc)
###### struct "Bool", which explicitly represents boolean values in Swift, is a value type that is either "true" or "false". Only simple boolean values are used in Swift to prevent errors. The values 0 and 1 are strictly int types and not convertible.
